  <h1>I’m truly sorry</h1>

  <p>
    I want to say this calmly, honestly, and from my heart.
  </p>

  <p>
    I let my emotions get ahead of my patience, and in that moment,
    I acted in a way I shouldn’t have. That was my mistake — not yours.
  </p>

  <p>
    You never owed me an immediate reply, and I’m sorry if my reaction
    made you feel uncomfortable or pressured in any way.
  </p>

  <p>
    I value you, your space, and your feelings — more than my ego,
    more than my frustration.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don’t expect anything from you right now.
    I just wanted you to know that I genuinely regret my behavior
    and I’m learning from it.
  </p>
